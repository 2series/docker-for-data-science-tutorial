## Description

Jupyter notebooks simplify the process of developing and sharing Data Science projects across groups and organizations. However, when we want to deploy our work into production, we need to extract the model from the notebook and package it up with the required artifacts (data, dependencies, configurations, etc) to ensure it works in other environments. Containerization technologies such as Docker can be used to streamline this workflow.

This hands-on tutorial presents Docker in the context of Reproducible Data Science - from idea to application deployment. You will get a thorough introduction to the world of containers; learn how to incorporate Docker into various Data Science projects; and walk through the process of building a Machine Learning model in Jupyter and deploying it as a containerized Flask REST API.

## Audience

This session is geared towards Data Scientists who are interested in learning about Docker and want to understand how to incorporate it in their projects. No prior knowledge of Docker is assumed. Proficiency with Git and the Command Line is not a prerequisite, but will make it easier to follow along.

Upon completion of this tutorial, students will be able to:

* Navigate the Docker ecosystem with ease
* Leverage containers as part of their data science workflow
* Productize & deploy a Machine Learning model wrapped in an API

Learn how to become a Full-Stack Data Scientist!
